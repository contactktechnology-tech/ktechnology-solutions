# Change Management Policy

## Purpose
To ensure changes are controlled, reviewed, and traceable.

## Change Categories
- Documentation updates
- Code changes
- Infrastructure experiments
- Policy updates

## Process
1. Create a feature branch
2. Make atomic, well-documented changes
3. Submit a pull request
4. Obtain review and approval
5. Merge into `main`

## Emergency Changes
Emergency fixes must still be documented retrospectively.

## Auditability
All changes must be traceable through Git history.
